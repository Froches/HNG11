        <summary>Master React</summary>
        <p class="summary_content">
          In the next two years, I believe I should have mastered React
          completely, especially if I keep up with this rate with which I'm
          learning it.
        </p>

        <summary>Get A Good Job</summary>
        <p class="summary_content">
          After I've mastered React as well as other web technologies, I would
          find a job at an ideal company with a good pay. <br />
          An ideal company would be one with room for growth, learning and
          expanding my knowledge. It would also be one with a good work culture,
          not one that overly stresses me.

        <summary>Learn Angular</summary>
        <p class="summary_content">
          Having mastered React, I would like to learn another frontend
          framework. <br />
          A good one to learn would be Angular since it's the second most used
          one after React.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Learn Next.js</summary>
        <p class="summary_content">
          Next js is also growing very quickly. It would be a great skill to
          learn to remain relevant in this industry
        </p>

        <summary>Become a Lead Tech Speaker</summary>
        <p class="summary_content">
          I'm a <q>people person</q>. I work very well with people and enjoy
          every moment I spend talking to people, or relating with like-minded
          people. <br />
          Following this interest in people, I currently host twitter spaces
          most weekends and I've recorded an attendance of up to 1k people
          recently. <br />
          I have also been invited to anchor/co-host several meetings, spaces,
          etc and have been complimented many times for my accent and my manner
          of approach. <br />
          It would be most fulfilling if at some point in the next 2 years, I
          can take this more seroiusly and be invited to high-profile events,
          meetings, etc and be recognized for this.

        <summary>Become A Mentor</summary>
        <p class="summary_content">
          If you can't show others how to do something, you probably don't know
          it. <br />
          Once I achieve most of the above mentioned goals, I would start
          mentoring people on how to do the same. As they always say, we rise by
          lifting others.

        <summary>Become A Full-Stack Developer</summary>
        <p id="last_summary" class="summary_content">
          The end goal is to be a Full-Stack developer. I currently have limited
          knowledge of backend technologies like Node, Java, Python, etc. I
          currently know the basics of creating an API, I understand most of the
          core programming concepts used in both Frontend and BAckend
          development. I'm currently improving on my frontend skills wnd will
          take some time to sharpen my backend skills as well <br />
          Before 2 years would elapse, I believe I should be a full-stack
          developer.
